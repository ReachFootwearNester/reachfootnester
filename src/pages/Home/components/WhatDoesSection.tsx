            In a competitive Footwear market, the ability to provide Footwear at prices attractive to customers while protecting margins for the firm is critical to survive, grow and thrive.

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A lot of material is wasted in Footwear manufacture, as the optimal packing of patterns involves very, many permutations and combinations. This would be a challenging task even for a highly skilled pattern lay planner.

            REACH Footwear Nester leverages new generation, powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to create optimal layouts of patterns saving significant quantities of material.
